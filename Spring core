Objects in java 
the object in java are the instances of the class that represent the real world entites and they contain the state (data) and the behaviour (method) and the identity 


class Student {
    String name;
    int id;
    
    void study(){
        System.out.println(id+" "name+" is studying");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Student s1 = new Student();
        s1.name = "Rahul";
        s1.id = 1;
        s1.study();
    }
}


Student class
@Component
class Student {
    String name;
    int id;

    void study() {
        System.out.println(id + " " + name + " is studying");
    }
}

Main (Spring way)
ApplicationContext context =
        new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);

Student s1 = context.getBean(Student.class);
s1.study();


Without Spring:
You control object creation
Classes are tightly coupled
Hard to test
Hard to scale

With Spring Core:
Loose coupling
Easy testing (mock objects)
Centralized configuration
Cleaner architecture
