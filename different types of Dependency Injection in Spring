Types of DI
Constructor Injection

Dependencies are passed via the constructor.

Best for mandatory dependencies.

Promotes immutability.

java
public class Student {
    private final Course course;

    public Student(Course course) {
        this.course = course;
    }
}
Setter Injection

Dependencies are injected via setter methods.

Best for optional dependencies.

Allows reconfiguration at runtime.

java
public class Student {
    private Course course;

    public void setCourse(Course course) {
        this.course = course;
    }
}
Field Injection

Dependencies are injected directly into fields using reflection (@Autowired).

Less preferred (harder to test, less explicit).

java
public class Student {
    @Autowired
    private Course course;
}
