🌐 Spring Security Concepts

Spring Security is the de facto framework for securing Spring applications, handling authentication, authorization, and other security concerns.

We can break it down into key concepts:

1️⃣ Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication: Verifies who the user is.

Examples: Username/password login, OAuth2 login, JWT validation.

Spring Security Components:

AuthenticationManager

UserDetailsService (loads user data)

PasswordEncoder (BCrypt, Argon2, etc.)

Authorization: Determines what the user can do.

Examples: Admins can delete, users can read.

Spring Security Components:

GrantedAuthority

@PreAuthorize, @Secured

URL-based security with HttpSecurity

2️⃣ Core Interfaces & Classes
Interface/Class	Purpose
UserDetails	Represents a user (username, password, roles)
UserDetailsService	Loads UserDetails from DB or in-memory store
Authentication	Contains authentication info (principal, credentials, authorities)
AuthenticationManager	Handles authentication logic
SecurityContext	Stores authentication info for current thread/session
GrantedAuthority	Represents roles/permissions of a user
3️⃣ Security Filters

Filter Chain: Spring Security uses a chain of servlet filters to process requests.

Important Filters:

UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter → handles login form.

BasicAuthenticationFilter → handles HTTP Basic auth.

JwtAuthenticationFilter → custom filter to validate JWT tokens.

ExceptionTranslationFilter → handles access denied and authentication exceptions.

Industry Tip: Custom filters can be added before/after existing filters to implement features like JWT validation or logging.

4️⃣ Password Management

PasswordEncoder

BCryptPasswordEncoder → recommended

NoOpPasswordEncoder → only for testing

Best Practices

Always store hashed passwords, never plain text.

Add salt and use strong hash algorithms (BCrypt, Argon2).

5️⃣ Roles vs Authorities

Role: High-level user category (e.g., ADMIN, USER)

Authority/Permission: Specific actions (e.g., READ_PRIVILEGES, DELETE_USERS)

Spring Security maps roles to authorities automatically:

@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('DELETE_USERS')")

6️⃣ HTTP Security Configuration

Configured using HttpSecurity in Java Config:

http
    .csrf().disable()
    .authorizeHttpRequests()
        .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        .requestMatchers("/user/**").hasAnyRole("USER","ADMIN")
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
    .and()
    .formLogin()
    .and()
    .logout();


Supports:

URL-based access control

Form login

HTTP Basic

OAuth2 login

CSRF protection

7️⃣ Method-Level Security

Use annotations to secure methods:

@Secured("ROLE_ADMIN")
public void deleteUser(Long id) { ... }

@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') or #id == authentication.principal.id")
public void updateUser(Long id) { ... }


Enables fine-grained security inside services instead of just URLs.

8️⃣ Session Management

Handles:

Maximum concurrent sessions

Session fixation protection

Remember-me tokens

Example:

http
    .sessionManagement()
    .maximumSessions(1)
    .expiredUrl("/login?expired");

9️⃣ JWT Authentication (Stateless Security)

Flow:

User logs in → server issues JWT token.

Token sent in Authorization: Bearer <token> header.

Custom JwtAuthenticationFilter validates token for each request.

Industry Use: REST APIs, microservices, mobile apps.

🔟 CSRF & CORS Protection

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

Enabled by default for stateful applications.

Disable for stateless APIs (http.csrf().disable()).

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Allows requests from frontend domains:

http.cors();

1️⃣1️⃣ OAuth2 & Social Login

Spring Security supports:

OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow

OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Social login: Google, Facebook, GitHub

Components:

OAuth2UserService → loads user info from provider

ClientRegistration → defines provider credentials

Industry Use: Single Sign-On (SSO) in enterprise apps.

1️⃣2️⃣ Security Best Practices

Always hash passwords.

Use HTTPS / SSL.

Keep JWT secret keys safe.

Limit concurrent sessions.

Validate user inputs.

Keep Spring Security and dependencies up-to-date.
